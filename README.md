# Student Management System (SMS)

The **Student Management System (SMS)** is a web-based platform that allows institutions to manage students, courses, teachers, attendance, fees, grades, and various other academic activities. This system aims to streamline operations for educational institutions, providing efficient management and access to critical student data.

## Features

- **Subject & Class Management**: Manage course catalogs, create class schedules, and allow students to register for courses.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Track student attendance, generate reports, and manage attendance statuses.
- **Fee Management**: Manage student fees, payments, and generate receipts.
- **User Authentication & Roles**: Secure authentication with different roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) controlling access to various system features.
- **Notifications & Announcements**: Send notifications and updates to students regarding events, assignments, and other important information.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Generate reports on academic performance, fee payments, course registrations, and other statistics.
- **Mobile & Web Access**: Accessible on both mobile and web for staff and students to manage their information on the go.
- **API Integration**: Provides RESTful APIs for integration with other systems, such as external learning platforms, payment gateways, and more.

## Database Schema

- **Marks**: Stores student marks for various subjects.
- **Fees**: Manages fee payments, including due dates, payment status, and penalties.
- **Events**: Records events and extracurricular activities for student participation.
- **Users & Roles**: Manages user authentication and role assignments.

## Technologies Used
